- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @DarthlNinja
  Iâ€™m really into ethical hacking and cybersecurity,
  and I love gaming and modding in my spare time. Right now, Iâ€™m working on improving my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills,
  hoping to break into IT as a career. I enjoy learning by doing and always look for new ways to challenge myself.
